### Cycle 1 Tool Overview:  WebApp Attack Vector Enumerator
WebApp Attack Vector Enumerator is an interactive python tool that facilitates the mapping surface area of attack of a web application. The tool achieves this by scanning a web application to enumerate services that are running and openly accessible, querying the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) associated with enumerated services, and finally querying ExploitDB to map the CVEs to exploits. The tool provides two workflows, manual step by step interactive and one step automated execution.
